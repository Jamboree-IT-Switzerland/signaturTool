# Mova Signature Generator - Migration Notes

## Migration from PHP to JavaScript

This document outlines the migration from the original PHP-based signature generator to a pure JavaScript solution.

### What Was Changed

1. **Removed PHP Dependencies**: All server-side processing has been moved to client-side JavaScript
2. **Configuration-Based Architecture**: Added JSON configuration files for better maintainability
3. **Multilingual Support**: Improved translation system with structured JSON files
4. **Single Page Application**: Combined all language variants into one dynamic page

### Files Removed/Replaced

- `src/index.php` → Replaced by `index.html`
- `src/html/process.php` → Logic moved to `src/js/main.js`
- `src/html/index_FR.php` → Integrated into main page with language switching
- `src/html/index_IT.php` → Integrated into main page with language switching

### New Files Added

- `src/config/app-config.json` - Application configuration
- `src/config/translations.json` - Multilingual translations and role mappings
- `deploy.sh` - Deployment script
- `migration-notes.md` - This file

### Key Benefits

1. **No Server Required**: Runs entirely in the browser
2. **Easier Deployment**: Can be hosted on any static hosting service
3. **Better Maintainability**: Configuration-driven design
4. **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices
5. **Faster Loading**: No server round-trips for signature generation

### Configuration Management

All translations and role mappings are now centralized in `src/config/translations.json`:

```json
{
  "roles": {
    "Responsable de camp": {
      "fr": {"male": "Co-responsable de camp", "female": "Co-responsable de camp"},
      "de": {"male": "Co-Lagerleiter", "female": "Co-Lagerleiterin"},
      "it": {"male": "Co-capicampo", "female": "Co-capicampo"}
    }
  }
}
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Deploy to production
./deploy.sh

# Build distribution package
./deploy.sh --build-dist
```

### Browser Requirements

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript enabled
- Local storage support (for future enhancements)

### Deployment Options

1. **Static Hosting**: Upload to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel
2. **CDN**: Any CDN service that serves static files  
3. **Traditional Web Server**: Apache, Nginx, IIS
4. **Azure Static Web Apps**: Perfect for this type of application

### Future Enhancements

The new architecture enables:
- Easy addition of new languages
- Form field customization via configuration
- Theme customization
- Analytics integration
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
